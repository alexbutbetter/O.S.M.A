# O.S.M.A

O.S.M.A (Open Source Medical App) is well a open source app designed for medical use. The actual programs people use at hospitals are VERY outdated... so that's why I made the repo.

thanks to bailey for uhhh.... making this usable? idk what to say, shocked that anyone would do anything to this repo


## How to build

1. Download pyinstaller (```pip install pyinstaller```)
2. Into a terminal, type ```pyinstaller main.py```
That will create a folder called ```build``` with everything needed to run the program, and one called ```dist``` that has the result including a ```main.exe``` You would need everything in the folder, but nothing else.

DISCLAIMER: As a Linux dev, I still don't know how to build for linux so uhh... i'm kinda of a shitty dev-
