# O.S.M.A

O.S.M.A (Open Source Medical App) is well a open source app designed for medical use. The actual programs people use at hospitals are VERY outdated... so that's why I made the repo.

## How to build

1. Download pyinstaller (```pip install pyinstaller```)
2. Into a terminal, type ```pyinstaller main.py```
That will create a folder called ```build``` with everything needed to run the program, and one called ```dist``` that has the result including a ```main.exe``` and if you are on Linux it will just create a executable called ```main``` You would need everything in the folder, but nothing else.

## Todo

What I mostly have in mind is to make it look better in just tkinter, aka just polishing it for the alpha build.
