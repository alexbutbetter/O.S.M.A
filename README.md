## O.S.M.A

O.S.M.A (Open Source Medical App) is well a open source app designed for medical use. Now, why did I do this? Well I wanted to do something in Python and realised how outdated the programs where so well... I said "screw it i'll make my own".


thanks to bailey for uhhh.... making this usable? idk what to say, shocked that anyone would do anything to this repo


(no hospital will ever use this)


# How to compile 

1. Use pyinstaller (```pip install pyinstaller```)
