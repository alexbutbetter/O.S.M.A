## O.S.M.A

O.S.M.A (Open Source Medical App) is well a open source app designed for medical use. Now, why did I do this? Well I wanted to do something in Python and realised how outdated the programs where so well... I said "screw it i'll make my own".


thanks to bailey for uhhh.... making this usable? idk what to say, shocked that anyone would do anything to this repo


(no hospital will ever use this)


# How to compile 

1. Download pyinstaller (```pip install pyinstaller```)
2. Into a terminal type in ```pyinstaller main.py```
That will create a folder called ```build``` with everything needed to build your distributable, and one called ```dist``` that has the result including a ```main.exe``` A user of your script would need everything in the folder, but nothing else.

DISCLAIMER: As a Linux dev, I still don't know how to build for linux so uhh... i'm kinda of a shitty dev-
